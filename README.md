# surfs_up

**Overview

The purpose of our analysis is to evaluate and visualize climate data as a potential proprietor prepares to invest in opening a surf shop in Hawaii. In planning for this project, the goal is to make sure that the business is sustainable year around, hence we researched and evaluated the temperature statistics for the months of June and December. Therefore, to obtain such data two separate queries were run to retrieve temperature data for the month of June and December. The queries were stored as a list then converted to data frame.

**Results

•	Summary statistics for the June temperature DataFrame are as follows:

total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

 
•	Summary statistics for the December temperature DataFrame are as follows:

total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

 
• Month	Mean calculated	Standard Deviation (Std)

•	The standard deviation difference between the two months is smaller (std 0.5)

**Summary

The climate data that we analyzed and visualized has showcased what the temperatures are during the months of June and December in Hawaii, it would be beneficial however to obtain and run additional queries to account for other factors that might impact the weather i.e., cloud cover, precipitation, storm systems etc. Running additional queries will also help the strategic project planning process by identifying constraints that can impact quality, delivery and the overall project success. For example, projecting the traffic flow of tourists and/or which locations are more suitable and economically sustainable for a surf shop business.
